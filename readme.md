# Mass Effect Exploration Tracker App

This app is inspired by my first playthrough of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. I've played the original releases and remember how tedious it was to track which systems I have been to. This app is a beginner's project to develop something usable.

The idea came from watching a "task manager" python tutorial on youtube.
